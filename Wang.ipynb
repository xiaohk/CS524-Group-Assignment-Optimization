    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use optimization techniques to find the best group assignment for CS 506, which maximizes the student happiness as well as assignment fairness, based on student's survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CS 506 (Software Engineering) is one of the most popular undergraduate computer science courses in UW-Madison. In this course, students are expected to complete a large-scale programing project in groups through the whole semester. Thus, wisely assigning groups is critical for instructors. Our goal in this project is to design a robust and flexible optimization model to improve the group assignment process. It will make teaching more effective and the learning experience more enjoyable. We have interviewed Professor Ben Liblit, the instructor for CS 506 in Spring 2018, regarding to the current assignment procedure. This model is tailored to fit his requirements and the data he is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CS 506 Group Assignment Process**\n",
    "1. All students are required to submit one project proposal in the first two weeks.\n",
    "2. The instructor and TA's choose about one third of the proposals for bidding.\n",
    "3. In the bidding phase, students read all selected proposals and complete a survey regarding to their preferences, and previous programming experiences.\n",
    "4. Instructor assigns students to groups based on the survey results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the survey, Liblit asks students to rank $8$ most interested projects, $3$ most desired teammates, and $2$ students who they do not want to work with. He also collects data about student's previous project complexity and life time programming experience, measured by lines of code. For the confidentiality reason, Liblit did not share those data with us. We [generated fake data](#6.1-Demo-data-generation) having a similar format in this project. Within each step, Liblit has specific requirements (i.e. group size limit). These requirement will be discussed in detail in the [constraints](#2.3.-Constraints) section.\n",

    "    <center><em>One question from the Canvas survey, provided by Professor Liblit</em></center>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Liblit would like to assign students to their interested projects or groups having their friends. On the other hand, he expects each groups to have a similar programming experience level. In this project, we consider two objectives, student happiness and group experience equality. We propose there is a trade-off relationship between two objectives. We will design our model in a way that instructors can easily change the weights of objectives and each single factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Liblit is using an optimization model, written in GAMS by some graduate students years ago, with fixed parameters. He didn't tell us any details about that method. Our goal is to make a more flexible model which can solve the same problem. Finally, we will analyze the model and its solution to gain more insights into the nature of CS 506 group assignment.\n",

    "From the plot above, we can see:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When $\\delta_1 \\geq 0.76$, the happiness score is not changing regarding to a decreasing tolerance level. In other words, our model is not sensitive to the change of $\\delta_1$ when $\\delta_1 \\geq 0.76$. \n",
    "2. The relationship between happiness and experience fairness is like a stepwise function. Within each step, the model is not sensitive to the change of $\\delta_1$.\n",
    "3. When $\\delta_1$ decreases after $0.76$, the happiness score is significantly negatively affected by the tolerance level. From this simple plot, we guess the relationship is exponential. Therefore, there is indeed a trade-off between happiness score and group experience equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to understand the \"stepping\" effect using the following image:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nop1GaK.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose pink dots are available inter solutions, the blue line is a changing linear constraint, and the orange circle is a quadratic objective function with different values. Then within the change of the linear constraint, we do see there are small gaps between different optimal solutions. Within those ranges, the optimal solution and objective values are not sensitive to the small change of constraints. That's why we see flat objective values in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a trade-off relationship, let's see if we can analyze the Pareto curve. Note that our Pareto curve is a little bit different from the standard Pareto curve that we discussed in the lecture, since our trade-off parameter $\\delta_1$ is directly related to one of the \"objective\". Read more [here](#relaxation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note the Pareto we have learned is plotted based on two minimizing objectives, so we use the range (\"variance\") and negative happiness score as two objective functions. "

It doesn't scarifies much of the student happiness, but gives a way better group experience range (comparing to use $\\delta_1=2$). Thus, instructors can use Pareto curve to help tuning the parameters.\n",

    "2. There is another trade-off between running time and tolerance level. Instructors can get an optimal solution pretty quickly if their tolerance of group fairness is not extremely low. If instructors really value the group experience equality, this model will take a very long time (limitation of our model). However, as we have discussed [here](#plot1), the group experience looks fair enough even when $\\delta_1 = 0.5$."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have demonstrated how to use an optimization model to solve a real-life group assignment problem. We also illustrated the model design process through variable determination, data manipulation and constraint/objective transformation. We found the \"tricks\" we have seen in CS 524 comes very handy, such as logical constraints, relaxation, trade-off and weighting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the trade-off analysis, we have shown there is indeed a trade-off relationship between student happiness and group experience fairness. Through constraint and objectives design, we made this model flexible such that instructors can control all the weights for objectives and each single factors. Also, instructors can add new parameters easily, such as student GPA, gender and ethnicity, to further diversify the group assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major limitations in this project:\n",
    "1. We didn't actually optimize the group fairness. In other words, the group experience equality is controlled by parameter $\\delta_1$, which itself can be an optimization variable. Even though it is good enough to limit the group experience variance in a small range in most cases. We still think that there might be a clever way to modify the variance-based objective, so that we can really find the minimal various solution. It can be a follow-up problem for this project.\n",
    "2. All the data we are using in this project are [fake](#6.1-Fake-data-generation). Even though we have tried our best to generate those data look like real ones, we cannot guarantee they are representative enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we do realize the importance of model interpretation. Interpreting the optimal solution really helped us see why it is optimal, and understand how model behaves in a higher level. With good interpretations, one can further improve the model by tuning parameters. On the other hand, interpretation tells us more information about the domain problem, which provides a way to design a more problem-specific algorithm."

One can argue the programming experience of CS506 students are normally distributed with mean $3$, and rounded into those five discrete values.

Therefore, it is reasonable to self-define a probability mass function and sample from it.
