# CS 524 (Intro to Optimization) Final Project

In the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xiaohk/CS524-Group-Assignment-Optimization/blob/master/Wang.ipynb), I designed a flexible and robust Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming model in Julia to solve college course group assignment problems. 

## CS 506 Group Assignment Optimization

I specialized my goal to improve [CS 506](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/courses/506) project assignment experience. The objective is to maximize the student happiness and group fairness. Through visualization, I gained many insights into the optimal solution and the domain problem.

</p>

Fortunately, the project got the highest grades in terms of "originality, creativity, insightful commentary, educational value, and general awesomeness." I am also honored to have a free lunch with our professor. 

## Notes
1. To run all cells in the [notebook](./Wang.ipynb), you want to have [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com) correctly installed.
2. Recommend to use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xiaohk/CS524-Group-Assignment-Optimization/blob/master/Wang.ipynb) for better online rendering of this project.
