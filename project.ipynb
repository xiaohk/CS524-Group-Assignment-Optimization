    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "CS 506 (Software Engineering) is one of the most popular undergraduate computer science courses in UW-Madison. In this course, students are expected to finish one large programing project in groups through the whole semester. Thus, wisely assigning groups is critical for instructors. Our goal in this project is to design a robust and flexible optimization model to improve the group assignment process. It will make teaching more effective and the learning experience more enjoyable. We have interviewed Professor Ben Liblit, the instructor for CS 506 in Spring 2018, and this model is tailored to fit his requirement and the data he is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CS 506 Group Assignment Process**\n",
    "1. All students are required to submit one project proposal in the first two weeks.\n",
    "2. The instructor and TA's choose about one third of the proposals for billing.\n",
    "3. In the billing phase, students read all selected proposals and complete a survey regarding to his/her preference, and previous programming experience.\n",
    "4. Instructor assign students to groups based on the survey results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the survey, Liblit asks students to rank $8$ most interested projects, $3$ most desired teammates, and $2$ students who they do not want to work with. He also collects data regarding to student's previous project complexity and life time programming experience, measured by lines of code. For the confidentiality reason, Liblit did not share those data with us. We [generated](#6.1-Demo-data-generation) fake data having the similar format for this project. Within each step, Liblit has specific requirements (i.e. group size). These requirement will be discussed in detail in the [constraints](#2.3.-Constraints) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liblit would like to assign students to their interested projects or groups having their friends. On the other hand, he expects each groups to have a similar programing experience level. In this project, we consider two objectives, student happiness and group experience equality. We propose there is a trade-off relationship between two objectives. We will design the model in a way that instructors can easily change the weights of objectives and each single factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Liblit is using an optimization model, written by graduate students in GAMS years ago, with preset parameters. He didn't tell us details about that method, and our goal is to make a more flexible model which can solve the same CS 506 group assignment problem.\n",

In other words, the group experience equality is controlled by parameter $\\delta_2$, which itself can be an optimization variable.

We still think that there might be a more clever way to modify the variance-based objective, so that we can really find the minimum various solution. It can be a follow-up problem for this project."

One can argue the programming experience of CS506 students are normally distributed with mean $3$, and rounded into those five discrete values. However, the rounded normal is actually not normal, and the variance is hard to determine without any prior information. Therefore, it is reasonable to self-define a probability mass function and sample from it.
